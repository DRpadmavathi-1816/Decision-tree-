  Decision Tree notebook project:

Decision Tree Classifier with Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier using Python's scikit-learn library. The classic Iris dataset is used to showcase the process of training, testing, and visualizing a decision tree model.
